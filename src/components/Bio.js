        As a Tucson native and lifelong creative, I thrive at the intersection
        of community, technology, and art. Inspired by the rugged beauty of the
        Sonoran Desert, I bring the same resilience and adaptability to my work
        as I do to my explorations of its trails and open spaces.
      </p>
      <p className="portfolio-text bio-text">
        My journey weaves together a love for authentic relating, creative
        expression, and the logic of programming and design. From hosting
        gatherings that nurture social bravery to crafting websites that tell a
        story, I’m passionate about building physical and digital spaces that
        foster connection and spark joy.
      </p>
      <p className="portfolio-text bio-text">
        I specialize in creating thoughtful, sustainable design solutions with
        an emphasis on collaboration. Whether I’m programming a responsive
        website, facilitating a conversation that goes deeper, or exploring new
        artistic mediums, my goal is the same: to create meaningful experiences
        that celebrate individuality and strengthen community.

        If you value innovation, play, and purpose, I’d love to collaborate and
        bring your vision to life.
